# thankYouCards

Summary: I decided that the most efficient way of writing the thank you notes was to divide the number of notes among the 4 servants and to have each one add and remove, and then search. This ensures that the correct number of notes gets written

Justification:This was the most efficient way as it was both simple to ijmplement and easy to check that all the notes had been writtem.

Experimentation: I tested with smaller numbers like 50 presents, then 500, then 5000, then 500000. It was easier to make changes when I knew which parts of my logic were correct already.
